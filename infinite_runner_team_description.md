## Game Description
"Gallagher's Odyssey" will be a Pitt themed infinite sidescroller. Players will attempt to travel as far as possible across the randomly generated landscape using physics based gameplay mechanics. There will be a single level which scales difficulty according to the distance traveled. The primary gameplay will be jumping and flipping while the player slides across the ground and flies through the air, such that the player may utilize the landscape to preserve or increase momentum. Additionally, a number of obstacles will be generated as part of the landscape which the player must avoid.

## Advanced Topic Descriptions

### Procedural Generation
The first advanced topic concerns 2D terrain generation.

### Physics Engine
The second advanced topic concerns the physics which will apply to both player and environment.

## Midterm Goals
* A simple "base game" without the advanced topics implemented. Movement, collision, static obstacles, and collectible coins will be demonstrated within a testing environment.
* Demonstrable backend progress towards implementation of procedural terrain generation.
* Demonstrable backend progress towards implementation of a physics engine.

## Final Goals
* 20%: Basic game implementation such as start and end states, player movement, and accumulation of score.
* 25%: Procedural generation of terrain, obstacles, and coins such that gameplay may last as long as player skill allows.
* 25%: Physics engine with gravity, momentum, friction, and rigid body collisions such that gameplay may last as long as player skill allows.
* 5%: Menus, UI, and controls which allow players to easily interact with the game.

## Stretch Goals
* Power-Ups: Randomly generated, temporary modifications to the player or environment activated via a collectible.
		1) Description.
		2) Description.

* Advanced Terrain: Additional terrain types with their own advanced physics, generated alongside other terrain types.
